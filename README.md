# Sukoon - A Website related to Mental Health Disorders

'PsychEval' is a full stack project on the theme of 'Mental Health ' built with the aim to act as a fully comprehensive website to raise awareness and provide resources regarding all sorts of issues related to the same.   

By dedicating our website to this theme, we aim to break the stigma surrounding mental health issues and provide a safe space for individuals to learn, share their experiences, and find resources that can help them navigate through their mental health journey.

Our website seeks to empower visitors to prioritize their mental well-being and encourage open conversations about mental health. We believe that by offering accurate information and fostering a compassionate community, we can contribute to a society where mental health is given the same importance as physical health. Our choice to focus on mental health aligns with our deep conviction that everyone deserves the opportunity to lead a fulfilling life, and addressing mental health is a crucial step towards achieving that goal.
